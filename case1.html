    <h1>Delivering Smarter: How FOODMATCH Is Revolutionizing Food Delivery</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <h2>1. Introduction: From Chaos to Coordination</h2>
        <p>
            Every minute, thousands of food orders are placed across cities. Customers expect them fast and fresh. But
            behind the scenes, delivery platforms must solve complex logistical challenges in real time: routing,
            preparation time, traffic, and rider availability. This case study explores <strong>FOODMATCH</strong>—an
            intelligent system designed to bring order to this chaos using cutting-edge algorithms.

    <div class="box">
        <h2>2. Why Naïve Logic Fails in a Fast-Moving World</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional delivery platforms often rely on the simplest strategy: assign the nearest available rider to a
            new
            order. Known as the <em>greedy approach</em>, this method doesn't account for preparation time, future
            orders,
            or delivery overlaps.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <img src="/image/GREEDY-APS (1) (1).jpg" alt=""
                style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; border: 2px solid #ad49e1;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                <strong>Figure:</strong> Graph illustrating why greedy approach is suboptiaml
            </p>
            <p>
        </div>

        For example, suppose an order is placed at <strong>R3</strong>, and the closest rider is at
        <strong>R5</strong>.
        The greedy system routes the rider directly to R3 via R4. If the travel time is 7 minutes but the food takes
        12
        minutes to prepare, the rider ends up waiting idly for 5 minutes—time that could’ve been used to fulfill
        other
        orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            To quantify this inefficiency, we define <strong>Extra Delivery Time (XDT)</strong>:
        </p>
        <pre><code>XDT(o, v) = max(current_time + travel_time_to_restaurant, food_prep_time)
             + travel_time_to_customer
             - ideal_delivery_time(o)</code></pre>
        <p>
            Lower XDT values indicate more efficient assignments. Greedy methods fail to optimize this, especially under
            scale.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>3. Batching Orders the Smart Way: FOODMATCH’s Core Insight</h2>
        <p>
            FOODMATCH introduces intelligent batching to address these inefficiencies. Instead of dispatching a rider
            immediately, it waits briefly to find other nearby orders that can be delivered together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each order is represented as a node in a graph. Edges connect orders that could potentially be grouped. The
            <strong>marginal cost</strong> of combining two orders <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> is calculated as:
        </p>
        <pre><code>mCost(i, j) = Cost(v, i ∪ j) - (Cost(v, i) + Cost(v, j))</code></pre>
        <p>
            If this cost is below a threshold, the orders are merged. FOODMATCH performs iterative clustering by
            repeatedly
            merging the most efficient pairs until no further improvements can be made.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

        <p>
            This process results in compact, efficient batches that reduce delivery time, fuel use, and rider idle time.

        <h2>4. Making the Match: Intelligent Graph Construction with Directional Awareness</h2>
        <p>
            Once the batching process is complete, the system now has two sets to work with: a set of
            <strong>batches</strong> (each containing one or more orders) and a set of <strong>active delivery
                vehicles</strong>. The challenge now is to assign the most suitable rider to each batch. This is where
            FOODMATCH builds the <strong>FOODGRAPH</strong> — a bipartite graph between batches and delivery partners.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <img src="/image/FOODGRAPH (1).png" alt=""
                style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; border: 2px solid #ad49e1;">
            <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                <strong>Figure:</strong> Construction of Bi-partite graph and sparsification for computational
                efficiency
            </p>
            <p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this graph, an <em>edge</em> connects a batch to a rider, with the <strong>edge weight</strong>
            representing
            the cost of that assignment. However, calculating edge weights between all possible pairs of riders and
            batches
            is computationally expensive, especially in real-time environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            To tackle this, FOODMATCH uses a combination of <strong>Best-First Search</strong> and a spatial concept
            known
            as <strong>Angular Distance</strong> to intelligently prune the graph and reduce its size without losing
            matching quality.
        </p>

        <h3>Efficient Pruning with Best-First Search</h3>
        <p>
            For each rider, a <code>best-first search</code> is performed from their current location to discover nearby
            batches in the road network. This helps prioritize geographically feasible assignments and avoids wasting
            computation on distant or irrelevant options.
        </p>

        <h3>Directional Relevance Using Angular Distance</h3>
        <p>
            Proximity alone isn’t enough. A batch might be physically close but in the opposite direction of a rider’s
            movement. FOODMATCH calculates the <strong>Angular Distance</strong> between a rider’s heading and the
            direction
            to a batch. Only batches that fall within a logical travel cone are considered for assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the rider heading toward batch <strong>B3</strong>. A new batch <strong>B6</strong> is physically
            close to the rider’s position. However, if accepting B6 requires the rider to turn back or make a
            significant directional deviation, it may not be worth it—even if the distance is short.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where <strong>Angular Distance</strong> comes into play. It evaluates not just how far the batch is,
            but whether it's aligned with the rider’s current direction of motion. If the angle between the rider’s
            heading and the direction to the new batch exceeds a threshold, the batch is excluded from consideration.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the illustration below, B6 is skipped in favor of B3 because including B6 would require a reverse move,
            leading to inefficiencies.

            These two techniques allow the system to build a <strong>sparsified FOODGRAPH</strong> with a limited number
            of
            high-potential edges per rider — dramatically reducing computation while preserving smart, context-aware
            decision making.

        <h2>5. The Final Match: How FOODMATCH Optimizes Assignments</h2>
        <p>
            After batching and building a sparsified FOODGRAPH, the final step is to decide which delivery partner
            should be assigned to which batch. This isn’t just a matching problem—it’s an <strong>optimization</strong>
            problem.
        </p>

        <p>
            FOODMATCH uses the <strong>Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm</strong> (also known as the <em>Hungarian Algorithm</em>)
            to find a <em>minimum-cost perfect matching</em> between riders and batches. Unlike greedy methods that
            assign the closest batch or first available option, this algorithm considers the entire system and produces
            the most efficient overall outcome.
        </p>

        <h3>What Is a Minimum-Cost Perfect Matching?</h3>
        <p>
            In a bipartite graph (like our FOODGRAPH), a <em>perfect matching</em> is a one-to-one assignment between
            nodes on both sides—in our case, each batch is matched to one rider, and vice versa. The goal is to find
            such a matching that <strong>minimizes the total cost</strong> across all assignments.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Hungarian algorithm ensures that each rider is matched to the most cost-effective batch, taking into
            account factors like delivery time, current direction, and overall system efficiency—not just proximity.
        </p>
<details>
        <summary><strong>Pseudocode & Complexity</strong></summary>

        <pre><code>
// Conceptual view of the assignment step
for each batch b in B:
    for each rider r in R:
        compute cost(r, b)
construct bipartite graph G(R, B, cost)
apply Kuhn-Munkres to find min-cost perfect matching
assign riders based on optimal match

// Time Complexity:
//   Let n = max(|R|, |B|)
//   - Cost matrix computation: O(n^2)
//   - Kuhn-Munkres (Hungarian Algorithm): O(n^3)
//   Overall: O(n^3), where n is the number of riders or batches (whichever is larger)
</code></pre></details>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>
            This approach avoids local optima and considers the bigger picture. Even if a batch is closer to one rider,
            it might be better assigned to another if it allows better overall routing for the fleet. That’s the real
            power of optimization over simple heuristics.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this final step, FOODMATCH ties together intelligent batching, spatial pruning, and mathematical
            optimization into a real-time, scalable dispatch engine.

        <p>
            Online food delivery may look simple on the surface, but behind every successful delivery is a system
            solving complex optimization problems in real time. <strong>FOODMATCH</strong> showcases how thoughtful
            system design, backed by algorithms and real-world constraints, can significantly improve efficiency and
            scalability.

        <p>
            From avoiding the pitfalls of greedy assignment to building intelligent batches, sparsifying graphs for
            speed, and using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm for optimal matching, FOODMATCH integrates multiple layers of
            logic to deliver more than just meals—it delivers efficiency, adaptability, and customer satisfaction.

        <p>
            As cities grow and expectations for faster, more reliable service rise, such systems demonstrate the future
            of distributed, dynamic logistics. FOODMATCH isn’t just about food delivery—it’s a blueprint for any domain
            where time-sensitive, resource-constrained dispatch matters.

        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #aaa;">
            In a world where time is the most perishable resource, smart delivery is more than convenience—it's a
            competitive edge.
